# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The app  we developed in this course is an inventory tracking application for a warehouse Its designed to authenticate an end user using a password and user-id to ensure only authorized edits take place. It is to set to keep track of inventiry within the warehouse such as available items, stoked items and out of stock items
# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful? 
The screens that were necessary for this application ti support users needs would be the main menu interface, user log in screen and inventory screen set with button actions and decisions. 
# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
The wat I approached the process of creating this application was by first gather all user requirements. After that was completed I went into a planning phase in which I would plan out how to create the wireframe of this application and how the UI would look and how this would benifit the user. After these two steps, I went to desiging the application in Java programming language. 
# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
I tested my app by running the built in emulator in Android studios. Once the app would run without any errors I knew this woudl pass our testing phase. 
# Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
Getting everything to come together was a struggle for me at first. I ran into errors that I was unsure of. After more research and practice however, this became more clear and understanding. 
# In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
The whole planning stage was my strongsuit for this application. I have the skills and knowlege to understand what a client wants, needs and requires within their software. Programming and implemnting are skills I would need to work on more.
